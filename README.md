# Learning from Practical Microservices: Building Event-Driven Architectures with Event Souricng and CQRS
## Chapter 1: First Pass

Learning a few things along the way, and struggling through the setup of the application. In my rush to copy things over, i realized that it was missing a few things since the `mount-route.js` file was not referenced anywhere. I eventually found the resources for the book. https://pragprog.com/titles/egmicro/practical-microservices/
